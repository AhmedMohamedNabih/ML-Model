# Predicting Loan Approval using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict loan approval decisions using multiple machine learning models.
A comparison is conducted to analyze the effect of regularization and model tuning.

## Dataset
The dataset includes applicant information such as income, credit history, and loan amount.

## Models Used
- Logistic Regression (L1 Regularization)
- Logistic Regression (L2 Regularization)
- Decision Tree (Baseline)
- Decision Tree (Tuned)
- Random Forest (Baseline)
- Random Forest (Tuned)

## Evaluation Metrics
- Train Accuracy
- Test Accuracy

## Results Summary
- Random Forest achieved the highest test accuracy.
- Tuned Decision Tree showed better generalization with reduced overfitting.
- Logistic Regression performed well as a baseline model.

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
